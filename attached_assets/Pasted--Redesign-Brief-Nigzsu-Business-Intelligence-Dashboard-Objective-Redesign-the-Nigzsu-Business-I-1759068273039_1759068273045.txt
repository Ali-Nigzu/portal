📝 Redesign Brief – Nigzsu Business Intelligence Dashboard

Objective
Redesign the Nigzsu Business Intelligence Dashboard into a professional Victron-style monitoring portal, but instead of solar/battery metrics, the dashboard will be powered entirely by camera-based activity data. The design must closely mirror Victron’s dark theme, sidebar navigation, top filters, and modular card layout, while repurposing the visuals to show business occupancy, traffic, demographics, and flow insights derived from entry/exit events.

🔑 Core Design Principles

Victron Look & Feel: Dark background (#1E1E1E / #2B2B2B), minimal borders, clean spacing, subtle hover animations.

Highlight Colors: Blue (primary), teal, and purple accents for active states, charts, and alerts.

Clarity: Metrics should be instantly readable; charts must emphasize trends.

Consistency: Same typography, card layouts, and chart styling across the dashboard.

Scalability: Must support future panels (new demographics, multi-location views).

📊 Data Source

Dataset Columns

track_number → Unique identifier for each person tracked.

event → Entry | Exit.

timestamp → Activity time.

sex → M / F.

age_estimate → Binned age groups (0,8), (9,16), (17,25), (25,40), (40,60), (60+).

All panels, charts, logs, and insights will be derived from this dataset.

🧭 Navigation (Sidebar)

Victron-style collapsible sidebar on the left with icons + labels.

Sections:

Dashboard (Overview) – live occupancy, summaries.

Analytics – traffic, demographics, flow analysis.

Data Sources – raw event tables.

Annotations – user notes/tags.

Snapshots – saved data states.

Alerts – anomalies or thresholds (e.g., high occupancy).

Event Logs – chronological activity.

Reports & Exports – downloadable insights.

Settings – client/system configuration.

🔝 Top Bar Controls

View Selector Dropdown: Overview | Occupancy | Traffic | Demographics | Flow.

Date Range Picker: Today, Last 2 Days, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Custom.

Quick Ranges Panel: Victron-style list (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, Last 12 Weeks, etc.).

📈 Dashboard Panels (Main Area)

Each panel is a modular card with:

Title

Chart or visualization

Export (PNG, CSV)

Tooltip support

Required Panels (mapped from dataset):

Live Occupancy Gauge

Calculation: (entries - exits) over selected time window.

Visualization: Circular dial (Victron style).

Annotation: “Current occupancy: X people | Peak today: Y.”

Traffic Over Time (Hourly/Daily)

Calculation: Count of entries and exits grouped by timestamp (hour/day).

Visualization: Bar + line chart.

Highlight: Peak hours colored in accent (red/purple).

Age Distribution

Calculation: Group by age_estimate.

Visualization: Pie or donut chart.

Tooltip: Show counts + percentages.

Gender Distribution

Calculation: Count of sex.

Visualization: Horizontal bar or donut chart.

Entry/Exit Flow

Calculation: Time-series stacked counts of entries vs exits.

Visualization: Stacked area chart.

Smart Insights (text panel)

Auto-generated insights:

Peak hour = max traffic timestamp.

Gender balance.

Youngest/oldest majority group.

Abnormal spikes (if occupancy > threshold).

Alerts Log

Example:

“Unusual surge in entries at 18:00.”

“Occupancy exceeded 90% of limit.”

Display: List/table with timestamps.

Event Log

Raw chronological view of events (track_number, event, timestamp, sex, age_estimate).

Filters: time range, sex, age.

Reports & Exports

Export summaries (traffic, demographics, occupancy) as PDF/CSV.

Include charts + tables.

🎨 UX & Style Requirements

Dark Theme: Match Victron (gray-black background, minimal UI chrome).

Hover Effects: Subtle glows or highlights on buttons, charts, and sidebar icons.

Responsive: Desktop and tablet layouts must adapt (cards wrap neatly).

Uniform Charts: Shared palette (blue for entries, red for exits, teal/purple for demographics).

Export Buttons: Positioned top-right of each chart (PNG, CSV).
