Hi Agent 3,

The current MVP web app works, but the dashboard design is poor, unintuitive, and doesn’t feel professional. We want a modern, SaaS-style analytics dashboard (think Pipedrive, HubSpot, etc.) with the following improvements and tech considerations:

1. Modern, Professional Charts

Replace the current basic charts with interactive, visually appealing charts (e.g., Plotly, Chart.js, ApexCharts, or D3.js).

Charts should auto-scale to available data: if only 1 day of CSV data exists, x-axis should reflect only that day.

Aggregate and summarize data intelligently; charts must always provide meaningful insights without manual filtering.

Use a mix of chart types depending on the metric:

Pie charts – Gender breakdown, Age distribution

Area / line graphs – Foot traffic over time, Occupancy trends

Stacked bar charts – Weekly traffic patterns by category

Box plots / violin plots – Average dwell time by age group or event

Other chart types as appropriate to represent data clearly and intuitively

2. Data-driven Defaults

All charts should auto-generate based on the CSV data.

Key charts to include:

Live Occupancy (latest snapshot)

Foot Traffic Over Time

Age Distribution

Gender Breakdown

Average Dwell Time by Age Group

Peak Entry Times by Gender

Occupancy Trend by Day

Entry-to-Exit Ratio

Demographic Flow

Weekly Traffic Pattern

3. Smart Aggregation

Time-based charts should automatically pick the best granularity (hourly, daily, weekly) depending on data span.

Avoid empty chart spaces; charts should only reflect actual data points.

4. Clean, Modern Visual Design

Use card/grid layout for charts with consistent padding, soft shadows, rounded corners.

Charts should have tooltips, hover details, and readable legends/labels.

Include subtle export buttons (PNG/CSV) on each chart.

Fully responsive for desktop and mobile.

5. Tech Stack Flexibility

Backend can still use Python for aggregation, but don’t limit to Flask. Consider frameworks like:

FastAPI – lightweight, async, modern REST API

Django – if admin/user management needs more structure

Node.js + Express – if JS full-stack is preferable for interactive charts

Front-end can be separate SPA using:

React + chart libraries (Chart.js, ApexCharts, Recharts, Plotly)

Vue or Svelte if preferred

Goal: professional, responsive front-end, scalable backend, easily deployable to Google Cloud Run.

6. User Experience & Automation

Users should see meaningful dashboards immediately — no filter setup required.

Charts should adapt automatically as new CSV data arrives.
